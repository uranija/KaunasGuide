# KaunasGuide2
##  Sixth project in ABND course

The objective of this project was to combine and practice everything I have learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. I had to  make my own multi-screen Android app to share my knowledge about a city i am very familiar with.

The goal was to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting my city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. My decision was which categories i want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category.

## Project overview:
 - Planning your app design and navigation before coding.
 - Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
 - Building layouts to display those lists of data.
 - Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
 - Creating your own custom classes.
 - Properly handling images or audio (if applicable).
 
 
 ## Project requirements
 - you'll make multiple screens, each containing a list.
 - to use explicit intents to move between activities, or you may choose to use a ViewPager combined with fragments.
 - you'll fill in those lists with list items, populated using a custom adapter.
 - It may make sense for some lists to include information such as a phone number or business hours, but for others it may make more sense to have a photograph. Design your adapter based on the information you would like to show.
